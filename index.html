        <h3>Welcome to the home page of my personal portfolio</h3>
        <p>I am a researcher and teacher interested in all things artificial intelligence and especially their intersections with human creativity and music.</p>
        <p>A primary purpose of my research is to understand music, creativity, and the underlying mechanisms of such activity through computational and algorithmic perspectives. One significant goal of my work is getting machines to be creative or produce artifacts that we might consider to be creative. My research is strongly situated in artificial intelligence with applications to all field in which machine inteligence or creativity are important, such as the performing arts, problem solving, human-machine interaction, or health technologies.</p>
	<p>In my teaching, I strive to ensure that as many students as possible want to learn, learn how to learn, and actually learn. My lessons prioritize active learning through problem-based and research-based teaching approaches that ensure high-quality education and opportunities to both engage in and benefit from research are provided to all.</p>
	<p>In my spare time, I enjoy listening to and playing music, working out, space stuff, basketball, and animals.</p>
